# roblox-gpu-reducer
Reduce Roblox GPU usage by temporarily disabling the renderer. Toggle-able!

## Usage
Press `F1` to enable/disable.
Press `END` to close, or simply close the program via X-button.

## Common Issues

`Wtf it's a virus?`
No, it's not. Windows is just flagging it as a false positive, because the code in the program interferes with other window handles.

`How download then?`
Disable your anti-virus. For Windows-Defender, disable "Real-Time Protection".

`How to use?`
You're dumb

`Can get ban`
No - unless you're dumb
